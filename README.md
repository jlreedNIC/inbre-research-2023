# PCNA Cell Counter

This project was completed in the summer of 2023, funded by INBRE. [insert NIH grant citation here]

This project was completed under direction of Dr. Seth Long from Lewis and Clark State College for the Mitchell Lab at the University of Idaho.

This project takes .nd2 files generated by a confocal microscope and segments the proliferating cells and their neurons found in zebrafish retinal layers by using a variety of computer vision techniques.

## Abstract

### Image Segmentation on Proliferating Retinal Cells

[work in progress]

As science and technology progress, the technical requirements of experiments also progress. Commonly, researchers are required to identify cells in images taken by detailed microscopes. We have developed an image segmentation algorithm that researchers can utilize so they donâ€™t have to manually count hundreds of proliferating cells in zebrafish retinal images. We use computer vision techniques and image filters to identify densely packed proliferating cells and their neurons in images taken by a confocal microscope. This image segmentation algorithm that does not use machine learning will allow researchers to perform cells counts quickly and efficiently.

## User Intructions

Tested on Windows and Linux.

[work in progress]
- `git clone`
    - If you don't have git, you need the following files to make it work:
        - `pcna_counter.py`
        - `seg_functions.py`
        - `RUN_FIRST.PY`
- run `python3 RUN_FIRST.py`
- install required libraries
- run `python3 pcna_counter.py [folder name]`
    - Currently, .nd2 files need to be in a folder you specify for the program to find them.
