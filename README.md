# Project Status:

Still in development.

# PCNA Cell Counter

This project was completed in the summer of 2023, funded by Idaho INBRE. [insert NIH grant citation here]

This project was completed under direction of Dr. Seth Long from Lewis and Clark State College for the Mitchell Lab at the University of Idaho.

This project takes .nd2 files generated by a confocal microscope and segments the proliferating cells and their nuclei found in zebrafish retinal layers by using a variety of computer vision techniques.

## Abstract

### Image Segmentation on Proliferating Retinal Cells

[work in progress]

## How to Download and Run the PCNA Counter

Notes:
- Tested on Windows and Linux.
- You need to have Python installed.

### If you have Git on your computer:
- Navigate to the folder you want the program in.
- Type `git clone https://github.com/jlreedNIC/inbre-research-2023.git`

### If you don't have Git:
- Download the latest release (located on the right hand side of the main GitHub repository).
    - Either the entire source code or the release code.
- Extract to the location you want the program.

### Running the program
- Run `python3 RUN_FIRST.py`
- Follow the instructions the script outputs to install required libraries.
- Open `pcna_counter.py` 
- Edit the user variables to have YOUR folder for the .nd2 file locations.
    - The program will loop through EVERY file in this folder.
    - Any file that cannot be opened by the program will have the name stored in a file called `file_error_files.txt`. You will have to manually delete the names from the file before each successive run.
- Edit other user variables as you see fit.
- Run `python3 pcna_counter.py`
